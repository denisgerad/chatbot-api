Humans evolved around 5 million years ago, and our understanding of the cosmos is limited, yet even the little of what we know is astounding, marvelous and leaves us thirsting for more. There is a need to find harmony between religion and science. God is the creator; science is his creation and God put a whole lot of science into creation. The universe is beautiful, creation is mystical, enticing us with the magic of reality and this blog is an attempt to reflect on the wonder and awe of both creation and the Creator.

Cosmos
The three basic questions that humanity has been asking throughout the ages are: Where did we come from? Why are we here? Now that we are here, where do we go from here? These questions have shaped our beliefs which has led to the basal paradigms of animism, polytheism, monotheism and the present day of scientific materialism. With knowledge comes power and with power comes ego and man has moved on that path of ego, disregarding the values of the word of God and blindsided by knowledge.

The Garden of Eden
The book of Genesis and the parables of Jesus are timeless because they are interpretations with an underlying principle. A parable is not to be taken by its literal meaning, or you will miss the point. The medieval church took the meaning literally, they believed that Earth was the center of the universe and with their geocentric view, caused much damage to science and scientists. It took the church 350 years and the grace of Pope John Paul the II to absolve Galileo of any wrongs. The story of the Garden of Eden is beautiful and meaningful.

Evolution and Entropy
The story of Noah signifies that God did not want evil to spread, evil is decay, destruction, entropy. Evolution is love, it is compassion, kindness and joy, evolution is Godliness. If you believe in God, then you must believe that God created the universe. Science is not a law unto itself or an invention of scientists but a means to decode creation. Just as religion is the word of God, creation is his science, and we must embrace science just as we embrace religion. As scientists unravel the mysteries of the universe, we can learn more about God.

The Big Bang
Scientists propose that the universe began from the Big Bang, that microscopic particles known as electrons, protons and neutrons filled the universe. The universe cooled, condensed and stars, planets, solar systems, galaxies and other celestial bodies were formed. And then came life made up of microscopic cells. Nature is not local to our planet, but it is the universe itself. If nature has the blueprint for creating life forms, then why only Earth and why not other planets? Genesis tells us that creation has a creator which is God, Genesis describes man as the final creation of God.

Georges Lemaitre
Einstein had proposed that the universe is static but when he applied his theory to the model of the universe, the outcome was an unstable universe. In 1965 researchers Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson of Bell Labs were studying signals from the Milky Way Galaxy. Their radio receiver was picking up a lot of noise, thinking it to be from the pigeon droppings on their antenna. They cleaned it up and chased off the pigeons but still the noise persisted. It was then that they realized this was not noise but actual signals from space or the cosmic microwave background.

Standard Model
he standard model of the universe is defined at a high level with about a dozen particles and less than half a dozen forces. The standard model does not consider gravity, dark matter and energy and subatomic particles. With the discovery of new particle and forces, the model is refined to make it more realistic.

Democritus 
he word atom means indivisible or that which cannot be cut. At that time there were no measurements or instruments, they were philosophers who discussed, debated and argued their theories with other philosophers. Democritus reasoned that atom were of different shapes and sizes with hooks to attach themselves to other atoms. Iron atoms were strong, water atoms were light and slippery, salt atoms were sharp and pointed and so on. Of course, we have cut and recut the atom to find more fundamental particles but at that point in time it was a remarkable discovery.

Aristotle
Aristotle was among the most influential figures in shaping both science and Western thought. His ideas on the geocentric model were widely accepted and later reinforced by the medieval Catholic Church. Because Aristotle's theories aligned with religious doctrine, questioning them was considered heresy. The belief that Earth was the universe's center remained dominant until Copernicus and Galileo challenged it in the Renaissance.
