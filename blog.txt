Blog Overview
Humans evolved around 5 million years ago, and our understanding of the cosmos is limited, yet even the little of what we know is astounding, marvelous and leaves us thirsting for more. There is a need to find harmony between religion and science. God is the creator; science is his creation and God put a whole lot of science into creation. The universe is beautiful, creation is mystical, enticing us with the magic of reality and this blog is an attempt to reflect on the wonder and awe of both creation and the Creator.

Cosmos
The three basic questions that humanity has been asking throughout the ages are: 
Where did we come from? 
Why are we here? 
Now that we are here, where do we go from here? 
These questions have shaped our beliefs which has led to the basal paradigms of animism, polytheism, monotheism and the present day of scientific materialism. When the first humans evolved, there were no libraries or books, our entire learning has been from the universe and Leon Lederman says this beautifully; If the universe is the answer, what is the question?

The Garden of Eden
The book of Genesis and the parables of Jesus are timeless because they are interpretations with an underlying principle. A parable is not to be taken by its literal meaning, or you will miss the point. The medieval church took the meaning literally, they believed that Earth was the center of the universe and with their geocentric view, caused much damage to science and scientists. It took the church 350 years and the grace of Pope John Paul the II to absolve Galileo of any wrongs. The story of the Garden of Eden is beautiful and meaningful.

Evolution and Entropy
The story of Noah signifies that God did not want evil to spread, evil is decay, destruction, entropy. Evolution is love, it is compassion, kindness and joy, evolution is Godliness. If you believe in God, then you must believe that God created the universe. Science is not a law unto itself or an invention of scientists but a means to decode creation. Just as religion is the word of God, creation is his science, and we must embrace science just as we embrace religion. As scientists unravel the mysteries of the universe, we can learn more about God.

The Big Bang
In the beginning there was a nothingness; no sound, no light, no matter no nothing, just a big formless void and from this void God created the heavens and the earth. 
Scientists propose that the universe began from the Big Bang, that microscopic particles known as electrons, protons and neutrons filled the universe. The universe cooled, condensed and stars, planets, solar systems, galaxies and other celestial bodies were formed. And then came life made up of microscopic cells. Nature is not local to our planet, but it is the universe itself. If nature has the blueprint for creating life forms, then why only Earth and why not other planets? Genesis tells us that creation has a creator which is God, Genesis describes man as the final creation of God.

Georges Lemaitre
The theory of the Big Bang was proposed by Georges Lemaitre a Belgian priest. Lemaitre was born in 1894 to devout Roman Catholic parents and at the young age of nine, expressed his wish to become a priest. 
Einstein had proposed that the universe is static but when he applied his theory to the model of the universe, the outcome was an unstable universe, indicating that the universe was either expanding or contracting and to solve this problem, Einstein introduced a cosmological constant. Georges while studying Einstein’s equation, did his own observations and proposed his theory of an expanding universe, not only that, but he also went a step further and said that if the universe is in expansion, it must have started from some initial point. Scientists were not comfortable about the idea that the universe started from some initial point, for a universe with a beginning meant that creation had a creator. Fred Hoyle another scientist sarcastically coined the term Big Bang, and it stuck.

Standard Model
The standard model of the universe is defined at a high level with about a dozen particles and less than half a dozen forces. The standard model does not consider gravity, dark matter and energy and subatomic particles. With the discovery of new particle and forces, the model is refined to make it more realistic.

Democritus 
The word atom means indivisible or that which cannot be cut. At that time there were no measurements or instruments, they were philosophers who discussed, debated and argued their theories with other philosophers. Democritus reasoned that atom were of different shapes and sizes with hooks to attach themselves to other atoms. Iron atoms were strong, water atoms were light and slippery, salt atoms were sharp and pointed and so on. Of course, we have cut and recut the atom to find more fundamental particles but at that point in time it was a remarkable discovery.

Aristotle
Aristotle was among the most influential figures in shaping both science and Western thought. His ideas on the geocentric model were widely accepted and later reinforced by the medieval Catholic Church. Because Aristotle's theories aligned with religious doctrine, questioning them was considered heresy. The belief that Earth was the universe's center remained dominant until Copernicus and Galileo challenged it in the Renaissance.

Copernicus
Nicolaus Copernicus questioned the long-accepted geocentric model of the universe. His ideas would eventually ignite a scientific revolution. Science and faith, though often seen as opposing forces, both rely on storytelling. In business, politics, and religion, narratives shape how we perceive reality, writes John Sutter. The influence of Aristotle, reinforced by the medieval Church, dominated scientific thought until thinkers like Copericus and Galileo paved the way for modern science, Sutter says. The Catholic Church upheld the belief that the Earth was the center of the world, he writes.

Galileo 
Galileo Galilei was born on February 15, 1564, in Pisa, Italy. In 1609, he learned about a crude telescope invented by Dutch lens makers. Inspired, he built his own, refining its design. When he trained it on Jupiter, he noticed what he initially thought were three fixed stars near the planet. But as he continued observing night after night, he realized they were actually moons orbiting Jupiter.


Issac Newton
When light passes through drops of water in the sky it creates a spectrum, and we see a beautiful rainbow adorning the sky. The angle at which the red light exits the raindrop is 42 degrees and can never be more and the violet light exits at 40 degrees and not more. When Apollo 15 landed on the moon, astronaut David Scott did an experiment, he had a hammer in one hand and a falcon feather in the other and he dropped both at the same time. The feather and the hammer drop to the ground as if in slow motion and hit the ground simultaneously, this would never happen on Earth as the atmosphere creates friction.

Albert Einstein
Einstein was born in 1879 in Ulm, Germany. He disliked school, detested memorization, and struggled with its rigid structure. His Munich schoolmaster famously remarked, "He will never amount to anything" He failed his first attempt to enter a technical college but succeeded on his second try. Even after graduating, he struggled for two years without a job. It was during this time that he published groundbreaking papers on theoretical physics. He proved that no object can travel at the speed of light because its mass is infinite.

Sun
Our sun is an absolute marvel of creation, creation is laws, laws are mathematical equations and that is how Einstein was able to describe the working of the sun through his famous equation e=mc^2. Everything in our world is made up of atoms and that includes the mighty sun as well. Our sun is a medium sized second or third generation star which means that an earlier bigger star exploded, and our sun was formed from this explosion. The mass of our sun is huge and creates stupendous gravity which pulls the hydrogen atoms to each other.  

Milky way galaxy
The Milky Way is a majestic spiral with four long arms of gas, dust, and approximately 300 billion stars. Our solar system sits on one of these arms, tucked away in a quiet corner. Stars orbit at breakneck speeds, and one of the fastest-moving known stars, S2, reaches an astonishing 11 million miles per hour. The answer lies at the heart of our galaxy—a supermassive black hole known as Sagittarius A*. This cosmic giant, with a mass four million times that of our Sun, holds an immense gravitational grip over its surroundings.

Dark matter and energy
In 1929, astronomer Edwin Hubble made a groundbreaking discovery while studying distant galaxies. He observed that almost every galaxy was moving away from Earth. This phenomenon can be understood using a concept similar to the Doppler effect, which we commonly experience with sound. The Hubble Space Telescope, which orbits Earth, uses this principle to analyze the light from distant objects. By measuring redshift, astronomers have determined not only that the universe is expanding, but also that our neighboring galaxy, Andromeda, is on a collision course with the Milky Way.

Quantum mechanics
Quantum mechanics introduces concepts that defy our intuitive understanding of reality. One such phenomenon is wave-particle duality, where fundamental particles behave both as discrete particles and as waves. Einstein dismissed this idea as “spooky action at a distance,” but experiments have since confirmed that quantum entanglement is real. If multiple quantum possibilities exist, could they all be realized in different branches of the universe? Physicist Hugh Everett proposed the Many-Worlds Interpretation, which suggests that every quantum event splits reality into parallel histories.

Global warming
Life began about 3 billion years ago with bacteria, followed by the evolution of cells and plants, which gradually altered Earth's atmosphere. Greenhouse gases formed a protective layer, trapping heat and maintaining a stable climate. The Agricultural and Industrial Revolutions allowed humanity to shift focus from survival to technological and scientific advancements. This progress improved healthcare, reduced mortality rates, and increased prosperity. But it also led to overpopulation and a higher carbon footprint.

Genetics
Two billion years ago, Earth was teeming with cells, simple bacterial cells and from this vast ocean of microbes, arose a single, complex cell with an intricate internal structure. From this celestial cell, came all life on Earth. How or why, this happened remains a mystery—one that nature has never repeated. Scientists have long sought to unravel this mystery, attempting to recreate Earth's early atmosphere. By combining chemicals, gases, and electric sparks, they have only managed to produce simple organic molecules, but no life.

The human genome project
The Human Genome Project, initiated in 1990 and completed in 2003, unraveled the sequence of nearly three billion base pairs in human DNA. It has been an amazing journey for science considering the many limitations that scientists are bound by because of ethics involving human life. A wrong mutation could create havoc and possibly destroy life on earth. We now go on a journey to understand how we were able to decode the gene as a unit of heredity. The word code has its origins in the Latin word caudex, or the sheets of material made from the pith of trees which were used for writing.

The Origin of Species
Charles Darwin was born on February 12, 1809, into a family of prominent physicians. Initially, he pursued medicine but was unsettled by the distressing realities of medical practice. After graduating from Cambridge, Darwin was invited to join an expedition to South America aboard the HMS Beagle. He set sail on December 27, 1831, a journey that would profoundly reshape humanity’s understanding of life. In 1859, Darwin published On the Origin of Species, outlining his theory of evolution.

Gregor Mendel 
Gregor Mendel was a priest at the Abbey of St. Augustine in Brno, Czechoslovakia. His fascination with gardening led him to study inheritance in pea plants. He observed that true-breeding plants passed distinct traits to their offspring. Mendel concluded that traits are inherited as discrete units, with one variant (dominant) masking the other (recessive) in hybrids. Though he did not name them, he had effectively discovered genes.

Eugenics 
In 1883, Francis Galton, a cousin of Charles Darwin, introduced a concept that would leave an indelible mark on human history. What had begun as a supposed scientific effort to improve humanity became a justification for some of the worst atrocities in history. The horrors of eugenics serve as a grim reminder of how science can be misused when detached from ethics and human rights. Today, while genetic research reveals the immense complexity of DNA, early eugenicists wrongly assumed that traits like intelligence and criminality were inherited in a simplistic manner.
